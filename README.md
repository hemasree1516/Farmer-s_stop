# Smart Crop Advisory System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Crop Advisory System** is a data-driven web application designed to help farmers make informed agricultural decisions. The system provides recommendations related to crop selection, disease detection, soil health, fertilizer usage, yield estimation, and real-time market prices. By integrating machine learning, satellite data analysis, and external APIs, the platform aims to reduce crop loss, optimize resources, and improve farmer income.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers often lack access to accurate, localized, and timely information regarding crop suitability, soil conditions, disease identification, and market prices. This results in poor decision-making, increased production costs, crop losses, and reduced profitability.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The Smart Crop Advisory System addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform that delivers actionable agricultural insights using AI models, satellite-based soil analysis, and real-time market data. The system is designed to be simple, mobile-friendly, and accessible to farmers with limited digital literacy.
